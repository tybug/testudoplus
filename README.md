## Contributing

Some professors have different names on testudo and ratemyprofessor. To solve this we maintain [an alias file](https://github.com/tybug/Terp-Course-Helper/blob/master/alias.json) which maps professor names to ratemyprofessor ids. 

Feel free to make a pull request to update this list! Pull requests are always welcome.
